    about: "I'm a graduate student in my final year of the Health Informatics program at Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis, and I'm expected to graduate in May 2023. I am open to opportunities and have a passion for creating software applications that make use of data and machine learning techniques. I worked on the LibreHealth EHR project as a Google Summer of Code student and mentored students after that. I can be an excellent fit for your team if you're looking to recruit an ML Engineer or Data Scientist."
